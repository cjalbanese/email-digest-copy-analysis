## How to Use This Data

### Quick Wins (High Priority)
1. **Search for "Closing Soon"** → Remove from all subjects (affects 125 emails)

3. **Search for "Cancer"** → Replace with "Oncology" (affects 56 emails)

### Optimization Process

4. Make changes and track new C2K ratios

### Templates to Copy

- Note the structure, keywords, and length
- Adapt these patterns to new topics
